[A reddit user](https://www.reddit.com/r/apljk/comments/tqdn51/solving_wordle_with_apl/i2kbwrp/) requested a J version of the wordle solving functions on the [mathsppblog](https://mathspp.com/blog/solving-wordle-with-apl) website, so I thought it'd be a nice way to learn and understand J.

The code may not be idiomatic, but I think it is correct.
